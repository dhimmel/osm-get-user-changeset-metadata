# Supplemental materials for "Mapping the Long Trail"

This is a repository of supplementary materials for the blog post at <https://blog.dhimmel.com/long-trail-maps/>,
titled "Mapping the Long Trail: the best is now free with OpenStreetMaps".

The [supplements](supplements) directory contains extra files related to the hike and blog post.

The [9376583](9376583) directory contains a history of OSM edits by [dhimmel](https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/dhimmel).
These were downloaded using [osm-get-user-changeset-metadata](https://github.com/andrewharvey/osm-get-user-changeset-metadata/tree/f166394692486fb56d3ef83ed6f7d2009994968e).
[long_trail_changesets.ipynb](long_trail_changesets.ipynb) reads these files and finds the subset whose changeset comment includes "Long Trail".
